While a few (like LUCE and BONSAI) show some supporting momentum from the 7-day and 30-day timeframes, the majority are experiencing a short-term surge that overshadows previous negative or neutral performance. This suggests that these coins may be highly susceptible to market fluctuations and that their current rankings may not be sustainable in the long term without more consistent positive momentum.
