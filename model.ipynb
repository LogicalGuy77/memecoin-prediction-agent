      "In this volatile market, the top 5 memecoins (GME, BONSAI, SPX, HAPPY, and SBR) are primarily driven by their recent 24-hour performance. This indicates that short-term momentum and hype are the dominant factors in their current rankings. Coins like HAPPY and SBR are particularly interesting because they show negative momentum in the 30-day and 7-day timeframes, suggesting a recent downtrend that has been interrupted by a significant, but possibly temporary, surge in the last 24 hours. GME and BONSAI also rely heavily on the 24h, but show less weakness in prior timeframes. SPX appears the riskiest in this group, with almost no positive support from longer timeframes and is therefore the most vulnerable if the 24-hour momentum fades.\n",
