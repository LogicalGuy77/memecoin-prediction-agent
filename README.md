### Final Response of Agent:
The top 10 coins show positive weighted relative strength, indicating they've generally outperformed other memecoins recently. LUCE and PORK have the highest weighted scores, suggesting strong recent performance. Several coins (MOG, RETARDIO, USA, BONGO, PUPS) show negative 30-day and 7-day RS but high 24-hour RS, implying a recent surge in momentum.

**Memecoin Analysis:**

I will now analyze each of the top 10 memecoins, breaking down their weighted scores and assessing the consistency of their performance.

**1. LUCE:**

*   **Timeframe Contributions:**
    *   90-day: 1.1351 * 0.0332 = 0.0377
    *   30-day: 13.2063 * 0.0547 = 0.7224
    *   7-day: 17.8388 * 0.2453 = 4.3758
    *   24-hour: 27.42 * 0.6668 = 18.2701
*   **Percentage Contribution:**
    *   90-day: (0.0377 / 23.4193) * 100 = 0.16%
    *   30-day: (0.7224 / 23.4193) * 100 = 3.08%
    *   7-day: (4.3758 / 23.4193) * 100 = 18.68%
    *   24-hour: (18.2701 / 23.4193) * 100 = 78.01%
*   **Strength Assessment:** LUCE's strength is heavily driven by its recent 24-hour performance, with a significant contribution from its 7-day performance. While it shows positive momentum across all timeframes, the 24h and 7d are what are driving the ranking.
*   **Comparative Analysis:** LUCE's weighted score is the highest among the top 10, indicating the strongest recent momentum. Its higher 30-day and 7-day RS compared to others (like MOG or RETARDIO) suggests more sustained positive performance in the short to medium term.

**2. PORK:**

*   **Timeframe Contributions:**
    *   90-day: 1.7297 * 0.0332 = 0.0574
    *   30-day: -1.2968 * 0.0547 = -0.0709
    *   7-day: -2.1428 * 0.2453 = -0.5256
    *   24-hour: 31.0228 * 0.6668 = 20.6813
*   **Percentage Contribution:**
    *   90-day: (0.0574 / 20.1461) * 100 = 0.29%
    *   30-day: (-0.0709 / 20.1461) * 100 = -0.35%
    *   7-day: (-0.5256 / 20.1461) * 100 = -2.61%
    *   24-hour: (20.6813 / 20.1461) * 100 = 102.66%
*   **Strength Assessment:** PORK's strength is almost entirely due to its exceptional 24-hour performance, which offsets negative performance in the 30-day and 7-day timeframes. This suggests very recent and strong momentum.
*   **Comparative Analysis:** While PORK has a strong 24h, its negative short-term and medium-term relative strength indicate it is not a consistent performer.

**3. MOG:**

*   **Timeframe Contributions:**
    *   90-day: 2.6825 * 0.0332 = 0.0891
    *   30-day: -2.1395 * 0.0547 = -0.1170
    *   7-day: -1.8749 * 0.2453 = -0.4594
    *   24-hour: 27.8701 * 0.6668 = 18.5898
*   **Percentage Contribution:**
    *   90-day: (0.0891 / 18.0952) * 100 = 0.49%
    *   30-day: (-0.1170 / 18.0952) * 100 = -0.65%
    *   7-day: (-0.4594 / 18.0952) * 100 = -2.54%
    *   24-hour: (18.5898 / 18.0952) * 100 = 102.73%
*   **Strength Assessment:** Similar to PORK, MOG's ranking is overwhelmingly influenced by its 24-hour surge, overpowering negative short-term and medium-term performance.
*   **Comparative Analysis:** MOG and PORK show a similar performance profile, with recent spikes outweighing negative trends in other timeframes.

**4. RETARDIO:**

*   **Timeframe Contributions:**
    *   90-day: 2.5889 * 0.0332 = 0.0859
    *   30-day: -1.9356 * 0.0547 = -0.1060
    *   7-day: -0.0802 * 0.2453 = -0.0197
    *   24-hour: 25.4173 * 0.6668 = 16.9548
*   **Percentage Contribution:**
    *   90-day: (0.0859 / 16.908) * 100 = 0.51%
    *   30-day: (-0.1060 / 16.908) * 100 = -0.63%
    *   7-day: (-0.0197 / 16.908) * 100 = -0.12%
    *   24-hour: (16.9548 / 16.908) * 100 = 100.28%
*   **Strength Assessment:** RETARDIO's performance is overwhelmingly reliant on its 24-hour surge, which overshadows negative or negligible performance in other timeframes.
*   **Comparative Analysis:** RETARDIO shows a very similar pattern to MOG and PORK, where recent momentum is the primary driver.

**5. USA:**

*   **Timeframe Contributions:**
    *   90-day: 1.7917 * 0.0332 = 0.0595
    *   30-day: -3.3867 * 0.0547 = -0.1852
    *   7-day: -2.6851 * 0.2453 = -0.6587
    *   24-hour: 24.1379 * 0.6668 = 16.0969
*   **Percentage Contribution:**
    *   90-day: (0.0595 / 15.31) * 100 = 0.39%
    *   30-day: (-0.1852 / 15.31) * 100 = -1.21%
    *   7-day: (-0.6587 / 15.31) * 100 = -4.30%
    *   24-hour: (16.0969 / 15.31) * 100 = 105.14%
*   **Strength Assessment:** Like the previous coins, USA's high ranking is primarily due to its 24-hour performance, compensating for negative performance in the 30-day and 7-day timeframes.
*   **Comparative Analysis:** The pattern is consistent - a strong 24h performance dominates, while other timeframes detract slightly from the overall weighted score.

**6. BONGO:**

*   **Timeframe Contributions:**
    *   90-day: 2.8472 * 0.0332 = 0.0945
    *   30-day: -2.375 * 0.0547 = -0.1300
    *   7-day: 0 * 0.2453 = 0
    *   24-hour: 21.3958 * 0.6668 = 14.2697
*   **Percentage Contribution:**
    *   90-day: (0.0945 / 14.2308) * 100 = 0.66%
    *   30-day: (-0.1300 / 14.2308) * 100 = -0.91%
    *   7-day: (0 / 14.2308) * 100 = 0%
    *   24-hour: (14.2697 / 14.2308) * 100 = 100.27%
*   **Strength Assessment:** BONGO's ranking is almost entirely driven by its 24-hour performance.
*   **Comparative Analysis:** This coin follows the trend of the others. The 24h performance is the only thing pushing the coin upwards.

**7. PUPS:**

*   **Timeframe Contributions:**
    *   90-day: 2.5703 * 0.0332 = 0.0853
    *   30-day: -2.6832 * 0.0547 = -0.1468
    *   7-day: -1.3748 * 0.2453 = -0.3372
    *   24-hour: 21.7381 * 0.6668 = 14.5091
*   **Percentage Contribution:**
    *   90-day: (0.0853 / 14.0957) * 100 = 0.61%
    *   30-day: (-0.1468 / 14.0957) * 100 = -1.04%
    *   7-day: (-0.3372 / 14.0957) * 100 = -2.39%
    *   24-hour: (14.5091 / 14.0957) * 100 = 102.93%
*   **Strength Assessment:** PUPS' ranking is overwhelmingly driven by its 24-hour surge, counteracting negative performance in the 30-day and 7-day timeframes.
*   **Comparative Analysis:** 24h performance driving the score.

**8. BONSAI:**

*   **Timeframe Contributions:**
    *   90-day: 2.2689 * 0.0332 = 0.0753
    *   30-day: 0.3228 * 0.0547 = 0.0176
    *   7-day: 0.5196 * 0.2453 = 0.1274
    *   24-hour: 14.9727 * 0.6668 = 9.9855
*   **Percentage Contribution:**
    *   90-day: (0.0753 / 10.2039) * 100 = 0.74%
    *   30-day: (0.0176 / 10.2039) * 100 = 0.17%
    *   7-day: (0.1274 / 10.2039) * 100 = 1.25%
    *   24-hour: (9.9855 / 10.2039) * 100 = 97.86%
*   **Strength Assessment:** BONSAI's strength comes almost entirely from its recent 24-hour performance.
*   **Comparative Analysis:** BONSAI's 24h performance has far more influence.

**9. CHEEMS:**

*   **Timeframe Contributions:**
    *   90-day: 0 * 0.0332 = 0
    *   30-day: 0 * 0.0547 = 0
    *   7-day: 0 * 0.2453 = 0
    *   24-hour: 10.7918 * 0.6668 = 7.1957
*   **Percentage Contribution:**
    *   90-day: (0 / 7.1957) * 100 = 0%
    *   30-day: (0 / 7.1957) * 100 = 0%
    *   7-day: (0 / 7.1957) * 100 = 0%
    *   24-hour: (7.1957 / 7.1957) * 100 = 100%
*   **Strength Assessment:** CHEEMS' performance relies entirely on the 24-hour.
*   **Comparative Analysis:** Its lower weighted score reflects the lack of prior momentum.

**10. MOCHI:**

*   **Timeframe Contributions:**
    *   90-day: -0.2539 * 0.0332 = -0.0084
    *   30-day: -2.4715 * 0.0547 = -0.1352
    *   7-day: -2.8986 * 0.2453 = -0.7110
    *   24-hour: 11.0382 * 0.6668 = 7.3614
*   **Percentage Contribution:**

    *   30-day: (-0.1352 / 6.5053) * 100 = -2.08%
    *   7-day: (-0.7110 / 6.5053) * 100 = -10.93%
    *   24-hour: (7.3614 / 6.5053) * 100 = 113.16%
*   **Strength Assessment:** MOCHI's ranking is predominantly influenced by its 24-hour performance.
*   **Comparative Analysis:** MOCHI is similar to many of the other coins in the top 10, relying on its 24h performance.

**Conclusion:**

In the current volatile market conditions, the top 10 memecoins are primarily ranked based on their recent 24-hour performance. While a few (like LUCE and BONSAI) show some supporting momentum from the 7-day and 30-day timeframes, the majority are experiencing a short-term surge that overshadows previous negative or neutral performance. This suggests that these coins may be highly susceptible to market fluctuations and that their current rankings may not be sustainable in the long term without more consistent positive momentum. PORK, MOG, RETARDIO, USA, BONGO, PUPS, CHEEMS, and MOCHI are overwhelmingly dependent on their 24-hour surge.
